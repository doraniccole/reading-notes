Key Points and download commands:
•	Observables are similar to promises but with major differences that make them better.
•	Partials: when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.
o	Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you don’t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in.
o	Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.
•	HTTP requests using RxJs Observable (Links to an external site.) library.
•	App Setup
•	Angular 2 uses TypeScript, so if you need a refresher on that, take a look at why TypeScript is your friend (Links to an external site.) and our TypeScript tutorial series (Links to an external site.).
o	TypeScript (Links to an external site.) is a compile-to-JavaScript language that brings compile-time type checks, classical object-oriented programming patterns, and powerful typing features to JavaScript.
o	TypeScript is a language that adds object-oriented syntactical sugar to JavaScript
o	Object-oriented programming (OOP) has been one of the most influential paradigms in the development of modern programming practices. If you've ever thought in terms of classes or inheritance, you prove the point: Those ideas have their origins in classical OOP.
o	To get started, you'll need to install TypeScript (TS). In this article, we'll be using Node.js (Links to an external site.), v5.11.0, and NPM, v3.8.6. You can also get TS bundled with Visual Studio 2015 (Links to an external site.), if you prefer.
o	`npm install --global typescript`
•	Before we get started and to save us some setup time, clone the Angular 2 QuickStart (Links to an external site.) then we can build on top of that.
o	`git clone https://github.com/angular/quickstart (Links to an external site.) scotch-ng-router`
