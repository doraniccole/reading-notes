How Computers Work
-	Started out as calculators-
Input
-	Storage
-	--algorithms series of commands
-	processing
-	-output
Circuits and logic
-	Input and output: information
o	Circuits
o	11-. 1 and
o	Adder takes two bits 
o	0+0=0
o	0+1=1
o	1+1=0

-	Lots of addition and subtraction
-	Smaller the computer- less distance electricity to go-faster
-	Engineering and design
-	Wires and circuits inside storing information using electricity 
-	Bit is the smallest piece of information a computer can store
-	True- false
-	10 two
-	On- off
-	Yes-no
Binary number system
Decimal – any number can be represented with 1 and 0
32 wires 0 – 4 billion
-	Text in binary
-	Sequence of numbers in alphabet’
-	Images in binary: photos videos graphics etc.
-	RGB
-	Typical image has millions of pixels
Sound is vibrations in air
-	More bits means higher range of numbers
-	32 bit better quality than 8 bit
Central processing unit
Master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
-	Math and logic
-	Add command
Binary command stored in memory
Binary code – software rewrite 
-	Python
-	Ruby
-	Blockly
-	Vs
Software tells CPU what to do
Operating system = master program with special abilities that let you control switching between programs 

Textiles
3D printer
Milling machine (3d printer)
Input store memory to store info
CPU calculate something
Output convert to physical output
Input memory output

Different types of output devise

Multiple CPU’s many gigabytes of memory to store input
